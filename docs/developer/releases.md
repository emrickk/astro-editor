# Release Process Guide

This document explains the inherited release infrastructure for Nevertheless Editor.

> **Fork status:** Automatic updates remain disabled, and the fork does not yet have its own macOS signing and notarization credentials. Do not push a release tag until those credentials and the updater signing key are configured. Current builds are installed manually.

## Creating a Release

### Step 1: Prepare the Release

```bash
# Ensure you're on main branch and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Run the prepare-release script
pnpm run prepare-release
```

The script will:

1. Read the current version from `package.json`
2. Propose a patch bump (e.g., `1.0.8` → `1.0.9`)
3. Prompt for confirmation — press Enter to accept, or type a different version
4. Run `check:all` to verify everything passes
5. Update version in `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, and `tauri.conf.json`
6. Run `pnpm install` to update the lockfile
7. Run a final `cargo check`
8. Optionally execute the git commands for you (commit, tag, push)

You can also pass a version directly to skip the prompt:

```bash
pnpm run prepare-release v2.0.0
```

### Step 2: Publish the Draft Release

After pushing the tag, the build workflow runs automatically:

1. Go to **GitHub → Actions** and watch the "Release Nevertheless Editor" workflow
2. Once complete, go to **GitHub → Releases** — a draft release will be waiting
3. **Edit the draft** — write release notes describing the changes
4. Click **Publish release**

Publishing the release makes the updater (`latest.json`) available to existing users.

Publishing also fires `publish-release-notes.yml`, which automatically turns the release notes you just wrote into a page in the website's Releases section (see [Workflow Architecture](#workflow-architecture)). You don't need to edit the site by hand.

**Download links** need no per-release update: the download buttons link to stable GitHub Release URLs (`/releases/latest/download/nevertheless-editor-latest.*`) that always resolve to the newest published release. Installers are **never committed to the repo** — they live only as GitHub Release assets.

## Workflow Architecture

### `release.yml` — Build & Draft

Triggered by tag push (`v*`). Three jobs run in sequence:

1. `create-release` creates a single empty **draft** GitHub Release for the tag up front and outputs its `release_id`. Creating the release in one place rather than letting each matrix job find-or-create it avoids a tauri-action race ([#914](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action/issues/914)) where parallel jobs ending at exactly the same time can create seperate draft releases.
2. `publish-tauri` (matrix) builds every platform in parallel and uploads its bundles to the shared draft release using `release_id`:
   - **macOS** — universal `.dmg` (plus the `.app.tar.gz` updater artifact)
   - **Windows** — `.msi`
   - **Linux** — `.AppImage`, `.deb`, and `.rpm`

   Each job merges its platform's entries into the release's `latest.json`, so the final manifest carries every platform's download URL + signature.

3. `publish-stable-assets` downloads the draft's installers and adds, to the same draft Release:
   - **Stable-named copies** (`nevertheless-editor-latest.dmg` / `.msi` / `.AppImage` / `.deb` / `.rpm`) so the website can link to permanent `/releases/latest/download/...` URLs. Legacy `astro-editor-latest.*` aliases remain available for existing links.
   - A **`SHA256SUMS`** file covering both the versioned installers and the stable-named copies.

The release is left as a **draft** for you to publish by hand (see [Publish the Draft Release](#step-2-publish-the-draft-release)). `release.yml` itself does **not** touch the website or commit anything to the repo.

### `publish-release-notes.yml` — Release Notes → Website

Triggered when a GitHub Release is **published** (or via manual dispatch). It adds the release's notes to the website's Releases section:

1. Runs `website/scripts/generate-release-pages.ts --all`, which fetches releases via the `gh` CLI, sanitises each body for MDX (strips the duplicate H2 title, the "Installation Instructions" boilerplate, and "Full Changelog" links; escapes curly braces outside code), downloads any inline GitHub attachment images into `website/public/releases/`, and writes `website/src/content/docs/releases/<version>.mdx`. Releases that already have a page are **skipped**, so re-runs and manual dispatches are safe no-ops.
2. Commits the new page (and images) and pushes to `main` as the `github-actions[bot]`.
3. Dispatches `deploy-website.yml` to rebuild the site. (A push made with `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger other workflows, so the deploy is dispatched explicitly rather than relying on the `website/**` path filter.)

This handles **only** release notes — binaries are never involved, since downloads come from stable GitHub Release URLs.

### `deploy-website.yml` — Website Deployment

Triggered by changes to `website/**` on `main`, by manual dispatch, or by `publish-release-notes.yml` after a release. Deploys the `website/` directory to GitHub Pages. Download links themselves are static stable Release URLs, so they never go stale — the only per-release site change is the new release-notes page.

### Flow Diagram

```
Tag push (v1.0.9)
  └─→ release.yml  (jobs run in sequence)
        1. create-release ........ make ONE draft release, output release_id
        2. publish-tauri (matrix)  build macOS / Windows / Linux
                                   └─→ upload bundles + merge latest.json into that release
        3. publish-stable-assets   upload stable-named copies + SHA256SUMS
              │
              ▼ (you manually publish the draft)
              │
              ├─→ latest.json + assets become public
              │     (downloads link to /releases/latest/download/... — never stale)
              │
              └─→ publish-release-notes.yml  (on: release published)
                    └─→ generate-release-pages.ts → commit <version>.mdx to main
                          └─→ dispatch deploy-website.yml → Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

Website source changes also deploy independently:

```
Edit website/** on main
  └─→ deploy-website.yml (path trigger)
        └─→ Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

## Auto-Update System

### How Updates Reach Users

The Tauri updater plugin checks for updates by fetching:

```
https://github.com/emrickk/astro-editor/releases/latest/download/latest.json
```

This file is generated by `tauri-action` during the build and contains the download URL, version, and signature for each platform. It's attached to the GitHub Release as an asset.

### Linux: Update Behaviour by Format

Linux ships three formats, and the updater treats them differently:

- **AppImage** — self-contained (bundles its own WebKit, ~80 MB). The updater silently downloads the new AppImage and replaces the running binary in place, the same model as macOS and Windows.
- **`.deb` / `.rpm`** — small (~10–20 MB) because they depend on the system `libwebkit2gtk-4.1` instead of bundling it. They cannot self-replace; the updater downloads the new package and installs it through the system package manager (`dpkg -i` / `rpm -U`), which needs privilege escalation. Tauri tries `pkexec`, then a graphical `sudo` prompt (zenity/kdialog), then a terminal `sudo`, so the user sees a root/password prompt on every update.

`latest.json` carries a generic `linux-x86_64` key plus format-specific `linux-x86_64-appimage` / `-deb` / `-rpm` keys. A running app updates from the key matching the format it was installed as (the format-specific key takes precedence over the generic one).

**Known caveats for deb/rpm** (accepted while Linux is beta):

- Updates can fail on headless or Wayland-without-polkit systems where no privilege-escalation agent is available.
- Because the updater installs the package directly, the package database's record of ownership can diverge from what `apt`/`dnf` expect (tauri [#4573](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4573)).
- We do **not** GPG-sign the rpm and do **not** run an apt/yum repository. Integrity comes from the Tauri updater's minisign signature (the `.sig` artifacts), not from distro package signing.

### Release Notes in the Update Dialog

Release notes are **not** read from `latest.json`. The `notes` field in `latest.json` only contains the `releaseBody` template text from build time, not the hand-written notes you add before publishing.

Instead, the app fetches release notes at runtime:

```
GitHub Release (published)
  ├── latest.json ──→ version, download URL, signature (used by updater plugin)
  └── GitHub API ──→ Rust command ──→ update store ──→ dialog (release notes)
```

The Rust command `fetch_release_notes` (`src-tauri/src/commands/updater.rs`) calls the GitHub Releases API, filters releases between the user's current version and the available version, and returns the combined markdown bodies. This handles jumped versions — if a user skips from v1.0.7 to v1.0.10, they see notes for v1.0.8, v1.0.9, and v1.0.10.

### Update Dialog Behavior

- **Automatic check**: Runs 5 seconds after launch. If an update is available and the user hasn't skipped that version, shows the update dialog.
- **Manual check**: Triggered via the "Check for Updates" menu item. Always shows the dialog, even for skipped versions. Shows "Up to Date" if no update is available.
- **Skip This Version**: Persists the skipped version to `localStorage`. The dialog won't show automatically for that version, but will show on manual check.
- **Download progress**: After clicking "Update Now", the dialog shows a progress bar.
- **Restart prompt**: After download completes, offers "Restart Now" or "Later".

### Key Files

| File                                            | Purpose                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/App.tsx`                                   | Update check logic (automatic + manual via menu event)         |
| `src/store/updateStore.ts`                      | Update state management (dialog mode, progress, skip tracking) |
| `src/components/update-dialog/UpdateDialog.tsx` | Update dialog UI (all modes)                                   |
| `src-tauri/src/commands/updater.rs`             | Rust command to fetch release notes from GitHub API            |
| `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` → `plugins.updater` | Updater endpoint URL and public key                            |

## Testing Auto-Updates

1. Install a published release (e.g., v1.0.9)
2. Create a new release (e.g., v1.0.10) with a trivial change
3. Launch the installed app — after 5 seconds, the update dialog should appear
4. Verify: release notes display, download progress works, restart applies the update

## Testing Linux Packages (without a Linux machine)

The maintainer develops on macOS, so Linux packages are validated through CI and Docker rather than a native install:

- **Build verification** — `ci.yml` (manual `workflow_dispatch`, or add the `ci` label to a PR) builds all three Linux formats on an Ubuntu runner and fails if deb/rpm bundling breaks. No release is created. The `rpm` tool is installed in the apt step so the rpm bundler is available.
- **`latest.json` verification** — push a throwaway tag (e.g. `v0.0.0-linux-test`) to trigger `release.yml`, which produces a draft release. Confirm `latest.json` contains `linux-x86_64-appimage` / `-deb` / `-rpm` keys, each with a valid signature and URL, then delete the tag and the draft release. This is the real auto-update gate.
- **Install / dependency sanity check** (optional) via Docker Desktop on macOS, against the downloaded packages:

  ```bash
  # deb — confirms libwebkit2gtk-4.1 and other deps resolve
  docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/x" ubuntu:22.04 \
    bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y /x/nevertheless-editor-latest.deb"

  # rpm
  docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/x" fedora:latest \
    bash -c "dnf install -y /x/nevertheless-editor-latest.rpm"
  ```

  A full GUI / auto-update run isn't feasible headlessly — Docker only confirms the packages install and their dependencies are sane.

## Troubleshooting

**Workflow doesn't trigger:**

- Ensure the tag starts with `v` (e.g., `v1.0.9`, not `1.0.9`)
- Check that the tag was pushed: `git push origin --tags`

**Build fails:**

- Verify `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` and other secrets are set in repo settings
- Check that all tests pass locally: `pnpm run check:all`

**Auto-update doesn't work:**

- Verify the updater endpoint URL in `tauri.conf.json` points to the correct repo
- Verify the public key in `tauri.conf.json` matches the private key used for signing
- Check app logs for error messages (Help → Show Log File, or Console.app)
- Ensure the release is **published**, not still a draft — `latest.json` isn't accessible from draft releases

**Release notes don't appear:**

- The GitHub API is rate-limited to 60 requests/hour per IP (unauthenticated). This is fine for normal use but could be hit during testing.
- Check that releases on GitHub have a non-empty body
- The Rust command has a 5-second timeout — slow networks may cause it to fail (the dialog still works, just without notes)

**Version mismatches:**

- The `prepare-release` script updates all three files (`package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `tauri.conf.json`) — use it to avoid mismatches
- Tags should match the version: tag `v1.0.9` should correspond to version `1.0.9` in all config files

**Download links broken / serving an old version:**

- Download buttons point at `/releases/latest/download/nevertheless-editor-latest.*`. Confirm the latest **published** release has the stable-named assets (the `publish-stable-assets` job in `release.yml` uploads them).
- If a release predates this job, backfill it: download its installers and `gh release upload <tag> nevertheless-editor-latest.* SHA256SUMS --clobber`.

**Website not deploying after a site change:**

- `deploy-website.yml` triggers only on `website/**` changes on `main` (or manual dispatch). A new app release does not redeploy the site (and doesn't need to).

### Manual Cleanup

```bash
# Delete a tag locally and remotely
git tag -d v1.0.9
git push origin --delete v1.0.9

# Cancel a running workflow: GitHub → Actions → Select run → Cancel
```
